**Relink Mod Manager** uses the generic ZIP Archive format for its Mod Packs. However, it is only intended to be used with Mod Packs either created by it or other tools that support its specific file structure. Mods created for other Mod Managers are NOT supported by it. However, [converting Mods](https://github.com/Relink-Mod-Manager/Relink-Mod-Manager/wiki/Converting-Mod-Pack-To-Relink-Mod-Manager-Format) made for other Mod Managers to work with **Relink Mod Manager** is a quick and easy process. The Wiki page includes a complete guided tutorial on converting your first mod.
