**Relink Mod Manager** uses the generic ZIP Archive format for its Mod Packs. However, it is only intended to be used with Mod Packs either created by it or other tools that support its specific file structure. Mods created for other Mod Managers are NOT supported by it. However, [converting Mods](https://github.com/Relink-Mod-Manager/Relink-Mod-Manager/wiki/Converting-Mod-Pack-To-Relink-Mod-Manager-Format) made for other Mod Managers to work with **Relink Mod Manager** is a quick and easy process. The Wiki page includes a complete guided tutorial on converting your first mod.

To get started on using **Relink Mod Manager**, head over to the [Releases](https://github.com/Relink-Mod-Manager/Relink-Mod-Manager/releases) section to download the latest released version. Then take a look at our Wiki's [Getting Started](https://github.com/Relink-Mod-Manager/Relink-Mod-Manager/wiki/Getting-Started) page.

> [!TIP]
> To help keep you up to date, the **Relink Mod Manager** will check for new releases on startup and inform you if there's a new update available. However, it will not automatically download and install new versions for you.
> This behavior can be changed in the **Settings** menu.
